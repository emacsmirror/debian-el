;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides emacs helper libraries specific to Debian users.

;; This package contains the following libraries:
;;
;; `apt-sources' Major-mode for editing Debian sources.list files.
;; `apt-utils'   Interface to APT (Debian package management).
;; `debian-bug'  An Emacs command to submit a bug report.
;; `deb-view'    View contents of Debian package, similarly to tar-mode.
;; `gnus-BTS'    Provides buttons for bug numbers seen in Gnus messages.
;; `preseed'     Major-mode for editing debian-installer preseed files.

;;; History:
;;
;; 2008-04-12 - GÃ©raud Meyer
;;  - Use apt-sources-mode for files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ too.
;;  - Use \' instead of $ for the end of filenames.
;; 2003-09-01 - Peter Galbraith
;;  - Created.

    "Return coding system for the \"control\" file in a deb.
This function is for use from `file-coding-system-alist'.

ARG-LIST is arguments passed to `find-operation-coding-system'.
The only operation handled here is `insert-file-contents' with a
buffer filename \".deb-INFO!./control\", for which the return is
\\='utf-8, and for anything else the return is nil (letting
`find-operation-coding-system' try other things).

This is done as a function because the filename passed to
find-operation-coding-system by tar-mode is merely the archive
member \"./control\".  By looking at the buffer-file-name we can
tell if it's from a deb.

Note: This only works in emacs22, in emacs21 or xemacs21 tar-mode
does something a bit different and doesn't reach here (and
there's no buffer passed to coding system functions)."
